APIs are essential tools that all front-end developers need to obtain necessary data for their applications. And the best way to learn how to use APIs are from their documentation pages, NOT Stack Overflow. Thus, for this activity, we will be using five different APIs taken from NASA to construct a simple website that does the following things:

<ol>
  <li>Get the Picture of the Day from NASA</li>
  <li>Get Data pertaining to objects nearing earth</li>
  <li>Get MARS Rover Curiosity pictures</li>
  <li>Get MARS Rover Spirit pictures</li>
 	<li>Get MARS Rover Opportunity pictures</li>
</ol>

 These APIs can be found in [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/35240/SVmtxerV?version=latest), and the necessary API key can be obtained from [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/) itself.
