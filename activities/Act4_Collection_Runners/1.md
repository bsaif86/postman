## Collection Runners in Postman

Up until this point, we've been manually sending a request to change each block's color. As our BitBlox site has 400 blocks, this isn't practical enough to send 400 requests. Luckily Postman has such a great feature called the Collection Runner that can help. 

You can access it by clicking on  **runner** in the top left corner. 

The Collection Runner allows us to efficiently send requests to the entire board by looping through all the possible IDs and executing requests for each ID.
