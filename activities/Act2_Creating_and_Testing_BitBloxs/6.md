# GET Request

First, let's create a GET request  for retrieving a single box from the website. Click on the collection that you created and add a request.

After you filled out the request name and request description, you will come to this page:

Now, fill out the route for this GET request like the following: `{{url}}boxes/<int:box_id>`

Since we have 400 boxes, we can replace `<int:box_id>` with any number from 1- 400.

Recall that our`url` has the value, `https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/`, therefore, in actuality, the request route that we are sending is : `https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/boxes/24`.

Try sending out the request now, what would you see?
