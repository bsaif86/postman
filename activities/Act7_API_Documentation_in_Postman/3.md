# Request Code Menu

On the right side of your API Documentation page, there is a menu that includes all of your request code from your collection. You will also see the Example Reponses from the saved examples. By default, the language is in cURL, but you can change the language to one that you prefer. To change the language, simply go to the drop-down bar next to the **Language** section. This is located at the very top of the Request Code Menu.

This menu section is important to those who would want to incorporate a code from the API documentation into their own code and project. To do so, they are able to view the Example Response code and know the functions of that code. Here is what one would look like.

If you click on the Example Response box, you are able to view the code in its entirety.

In addition to that, you will also see the status of the response in this menu gives you the status of the response. For instance, in each example request, you can either get a failure or success status to indicate the status of the response. Failure is signifed with the 404 code while the success status is signified through the 200 code. You can see this represented in the images below, indicated by the red circles.
