Now that we know the API call works and what it will return once called, we can now start writing code for our website. First, we will want to use Axios to perform our API call. For those not in the know, Axios is a very popular JavaScript library you can use to perform HTTP requests. In other words, it is another version of fetch and XLMHttprequest.

 Now, we can make a function inside our code called ``` showPicture()```, with Axios doing the API call and our state being updated with the response from Axios. Once that is done, we can now move on to implementing getting data about objects nearing earth.
