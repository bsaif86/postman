# Introduction Menu

In our published Postman API document, we have three main menus, the introduciton menu, main menu, and request code menu. The link to the API documentation we will be covering is https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7397255/SWLh4RrX?version=latest.

On the left size of the webpage, there is a menu that contains all the folders and the requests. This is the introduction menu.

We can click the different requestes and see more details of it in the main menu. The introduction menu allows us to easily skip to a certain request's documentation by simply clicking for it instead of scrolling through the documentation to find that particular request.
