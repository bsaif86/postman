<!--title={Collection Runner Part 3}-->

Now choose the Environment that you set up.

As we have 400 blocks, we want to do 400 iterations. If we wanted to delete only half the board, we could just do the first 200 blocks by using 200 iterations. 

Its up to you whether or not you want to add a delay to the **Run**. For some applications, a delay is useful, but for simply clearing the board, adding a delay has no significant contributions. 

For our run we want to log all requests. 

Postman Collection Runner allows us to upload a datafile that it will read from and cycle through. In other words, if we upload a datafile containing all the box numbers, Postman will send a unique request for each box number. This will allows us to clear our board efficiently. 

For our datafile, we have the option of using either a .csv or .json file. 

The format for our `.csv` should look like so:

with the numbers continuing up to 400. 

If we were to use a `.json` file, the format would look like so

The text from the .csv file is available for you to copy and paste so you don't have to write it out yourself.
