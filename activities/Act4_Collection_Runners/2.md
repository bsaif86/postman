<!--title={Collection Runner Part 2}-->

Our first task will be to reset the board. 

Go to the **delete** request, and edit the url so inside of the box number, we have a variable instead. As with most variables, you're free to call this variable whatever you'd like but we will be calling it **box_id**. When using variable names in Postman, surround them with two brackets like so: **{{box_id}}**.

The delete URL should now look like this

```
https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/delete/{{box_id}}

OR 

{{url}}delete/{{box_id}}
```

Now if we open our Runner tab, something like this should show up.

For the collection portion, simply click on your folder with all the requests and choose the **Delete** one to run.
