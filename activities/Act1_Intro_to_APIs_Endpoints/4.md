<!--title={API Authentication}-->

Many API's require an **API key**, a unique code for each client (including us) to use their API!

An example looks like this `0imfnc8mVLWwsAawjYr4Rx-Af50DDqtlx` (Note: this api key refers to nothing).

They look like a jumble of characters to make it hard to guess, like a secure password, but we must not expose it to the world or else someone may use the API and <u>abuse it under your identity</u> (a very bad thing for you and the API owner)!



Postman supports API authentication, too! Let's say our API key is `0imfnc8mVLWwsAawjYr4Rx-Af50DDqtlx` and we want to include it in our **http request**.



In Postman, click on the Authorization tab.

By default, no authorization is used. Under TYPE, change "No Auth" to "API key" to let Postman know that we have an API key we want to include in our request.

For the value parameter, copy and paste our API key `0imfnc8mVLWwsAawjYr4Rx-Af50DDqtlx`. Now, each click to the Send button adds this api_key as part of the request.

That's it! We can test endpoints using an API Key now.
