# API

Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of functions and procedures that allow applications to access the contents of another developer's server.

They let servers communicate with each other and transfer data securely back and forth.

Exposing source code to a third-party server is dangerous and could compromise the entire server providing the access, so APIs allow authentication keys to ensure safe transfer.
