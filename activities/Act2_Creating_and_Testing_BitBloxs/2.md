# Using cURL

To play the game, we need to figure out a way to send HTTP requests. One way to do it is through using cURL, but what is it? Well, cURL is a simple command-line tool for getting or sending data including files using URL syntax. You can test sending different types of requests by opening your Terminal/Command Prompt, and by typing a few commands.

### Get Requests

We use a GET request when we want to **query a collection of data** or a **specific piece of data**. GET requests return a data object (usually in JSON) and a 200 status code. 

**Note:** GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effects on the collection

```
curl --location --request GET "https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/boxes?api_key=thisistheapikey"
```

### Post Requests

POST requests are **used to send additional data** from the user to the server. It creates a new object for the data.

* You are “posting” data to the API
* POST requests generally don’t return data, just a 200 status code

```
curl --location --request POST "https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/change/23/yellow?api_key=thisistheapikey"
```
