The first thing to do, whenever looking at documentation, is to find the menu bar. For this documentation page, the menu is on the side and cleanly groups each api call into folders.

From there, we can see that one of the folders says "Astronomy Picture of the Da...". In that folders lies the Astronomy Picture of the Day APl. Once you have clicked the link to the only API inside that folder, It is important we read two things first in this order:

1) The explanation/description for the API

2) The Parameters and Headers for the API 

These two are important as the first gives you a brief overview of what the API can do, while the second tells you how you can use the API.

For this documentation, there are two descriptions for their APIs. The first gives a summary of what **all** the APIs in the group does, while the second decription is more specific to that one API.  The parameters and headers, on the other hand, are below the second description for the API.

The Parameters and Headers section of every API Documentation is important to read as it tells you the necessary data you would need to send along with the request in order to get the correct response. After reading the description and knowing the parameters and headers for this specific API, we can now test our API call in postman.
