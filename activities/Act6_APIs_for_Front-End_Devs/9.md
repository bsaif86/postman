Just like before, we will copy and paste the found API link onto Postman to see what the response will be. Once we get the JSON object back as a response, we will want to start experimenting again with our API. For the earth_date value, we will want to change it to 2012-6-3 and we should see a blank array of photos as a response:

<img src="Screen Shot 2020-01-11 at 10.32.53 PM.png" alt="photos" style="zoom:50%;" />

From this, we can see that Mars Rover - Curiosity did not take any photo on that day. And that is because the Curiosity Rover did not land on Mars until August 6, 2012. The other two APIs should have a similar problem, where the user may input a date where the Mars Rover of that API is either out of service or has yet to land on Mars.  Thus, as we implement these APIs in our code, we should specify for each one the land date and end of service of each respective rover.  The implementations should be very similar to past implementations, were we create a function, use Axios to make a API call, and change our state to the response we get.
