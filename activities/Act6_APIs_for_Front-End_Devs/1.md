As a front-end developer, one will often find one's self scouring through the internet hoping to find answers to various technical problems. And their search, more often than not, will lead them to two main sources of information: Stack Overflow and a documentation page.

###Stack Overflow vs Documentation

Stack Overflow is a great source of information for all programmers. However, one important thing to note is that SO is <em>not</em> a tutorial website/forum. It does not tell you how to use a language or programming tool in complete detail. Instead, it is a place where one can ask specific questions and get detailed answers pertaining to specific situations. Therefore, it is not a great place to look to when learning new things.

The documentation page, on the other hand, contains everything one needs to understand the full use of a tool or language and thus should be the first thing one looks at before moving to SO. By looking at the documentation first, one gets a good preliminary understanding of what they can and should do. Thus, once one has a good grasp of the new content, one would be able to ask more meaningful questions instead of blindly going through various SO posts to learn, leading to holes being formed in one's knowledge and asking wrong questions.
