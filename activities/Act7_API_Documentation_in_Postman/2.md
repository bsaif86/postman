- Markdown desription of a request is important because it tells us more about what is the request is used for. It gives user more context as to how it is used and why such requests are there.
- Parameters (PARAMS) descriptions allow us to know how to format our parameters when performing our own requests to the API. For the Mars Rover - Spirit, there is a parameter called earth_date. From the documentation, we learn that it must be in YYYY-MM-DD format for our GET request to work.
