<!--title={Setting Up a mock Server}-->

Let's learn how to set up a mock server in Postman!

Before we dive in, know that Postman matches requests and generates responses from mocks from a collection, but users can still create a mock server without already having a collection, which is what we will be doing.

To start, go into the Postman app and click on the "New" button on the upper left-hand corner to select the "Mock Server" option. Here, you are going to "Create a new collection", then enter a unique path name under "Request Path" and your desired text output under "Response Body", as shown below.

The next page will ask you to name you mock server, and there is also the option to make your mock server private as well. This feature will only allow people with the correct API key to access the collection, and this can come in handy for sharing information within a team.

When you exit the window, you will notice that you have a new collection with a request and a mock endpoint URL with the path name that you gave itâ€”in this example, the URL will be "{{url}}/hello". When you hit "Send", you are sending a request to that mock server at "/hello", and the text you entered in the response body should appear below!
