<!--title={Basics of API development}-->

We are going to learn what an API is and why developers use them all the time!

APIs are the online doors that allow people to interact with each other without knowing what's inside

In computer terms, APIs allow programs to interact with each other without exposing source code

They are useful because they allow faster development

You don't have to build everything from scratch, since someone else already did it for you!

An example is the Pusher API that allows you to get real time notifications on your phone, which if you had to do from scratch would take much longer!

There's also data APIs that make authenticated access to all kinds of data easy! If we wanted to get a bunch of real-time data on the weather, we could use the OpenWeatherMap API.

**RESTful APIs** allow programs to communicate with each other using **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Requests

Any http link you see is a link between the webpage and server.

The RESTful API uses HTTP to get , create, delete, or update data



For example, http://google.com is a request, and when you visit it, what you see on your browser when the page loads is the response

![httpmethods](https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/labs/httpmethods.png)

When you visit a webpage, you send an http request to an endpoint.

Endpoints are the receiving end of all your API requests. It takes a request + data and returns a response.

Endpoints will always return a status code (and possibly data depending on which http request it received)



In a fast food restaurant drive-thru, you (the customer) orders a meal. The cook (the endpoint) takes your order (the http request) and returns the meal you ordered (the data returned) as well as a message of how things went, whether the order was processed correctly or "sorry, our ice cream machine broke" (status code).
