# Using cURL Part II

### Put Requests

A `PUT` request is **used to change existing data**. This differs from a `POST` request which creates new data.

```
curl --location --request PUT "https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/change/23/blue?api_key=thisistheapikey"
```

### Delete Requests

A `DELETE` method is **used to delete existing data**.

```
curl --location --request DELETE "https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/delete/23?api_key=thisistheapikey"
```

#### Status Codes

Response codes are issued by the server as a response to the user's request made to the server. Here are a few common ones for the four types we explored:

| Response Code  | HTTP Operation          | Response Body Contents     | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| 201 Created    | `POST`                  | Resources that was created | Successful creation of a resource.                           |
| 202 Accepted   | `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | N/A                        | The request was received.                                    |
