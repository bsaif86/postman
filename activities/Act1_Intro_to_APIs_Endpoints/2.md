<!--title={Using cURL}-->

cURL is a command-line tool for getting or sending data including files using URL syntax. 

We use a GET request when we want to **query a collection of data** or a **specific piece of data**

GET requests return a data object (usually in JSON) and a 200 status code

```
curl --location --request GET "https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/boxes?api_key=thisistheapikey"
```

POST requests are **used to send data** to the server. It creates a new object.

- You are “posting” data to the API
- POST requests generally don’t return data, just a 200 status code

```
curl --location --request POST "https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/change/23/yellow?api_key=thisistheapikey"
```

A PUT request is **used to change existing data** 

```
curl --location --request PUT "https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/change/23/blue?api_key=thisistheapikey"
```

A DELETE method is **used to delete existing data**

```
curl --location --request DELETE "https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/delete/23?api_key=thisistheapikey"
```
